For Minecraft 1.20.1.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why HMCL?
Other launchers do **NOT** come with built-in support for offline (non-premium) accounts. Support for offline accounts is crucial for this project, as premium accounts can only be obtained via traceable means of transactions, extremely dangerous to those who may get themselves targeted.

This is also the reason we ship modified versions of certain mods, to remove their requirements of premium accounts. We also encourage developers of these mods to enroll alternative measures, catering the non-premium players as well, namely **HDSkins** for their pony skin support.

### Why Fabric?
**Forge**: Forge is clunky, so is NeoForge in 1.20.1 as they abandoned development on this version.

**Quilt**: Quilt breaks compatibility with a lot of Fabric mods.

**Fabric**: It's just optimized and stable.
